It is with [[INSERT SLIGHTLY INAPPROPRIATE SIGN OF HAPPINESS HERE]] that I want
to announce, on behalf of the Yapsi development team, the August 2010 release
of Yapsi, a Perl 6 compiler written in Perl 6.

You can get it here -- [[INSERT ENCOURAGEMENT HERE]]!

 <http://github.com/downloads/masak/yapsi/yapsi-2010.08.tar.gz>

Yapsi is implemented in Perl 6. It thus requires a Perl 6 implementation to
build and run. We recommend the 'alpha' branch of Rakudo for this purpose.
In practice, this means downloading Rakudo Minneapolis (#25) from January
2010.

Yapsi is an "official and complete" implementation of Perl 6. [[INSERT SILLY
RATIONALIZATIONS HERE]]

Here's how to get Yapsi up and running, once you have it:

* Make sure you have a built Rakudo alpha in your $PATH as 'alpha'.
* (Optionally) run 'make' for a load-time speedup.

This month's release introduces [[masak will insert things here]].

Quite a lot of features are within reach of people who are interested in
hacking on Yapsi. See the doc/LOLHALP file for a list of 'em.

Yapsi consists of a compiler and a runtime. [[INSERT MORE SILLY THING HERE,
INCLUDING SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT SIC CHANGES OFTEN AND ONE SHOULDN'T
DEPEND ON IT BEING STABLE]]

An overarching goal for making a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime is to use it as
a server for various other projects, which will hook in at different steps:

* A time-traveling debugger (tardis), which hooks into the runtime.
* A coverage tool (lid), which will also hook into the runtime.
* A syntax checker (sigmund), which will use output from the parser.

Another overarching goal is to optimize for fun while learning about parsers,
compilers, and runtimes. We wish you the appropriate amount of fun!
