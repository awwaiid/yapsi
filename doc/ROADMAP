Yapsi Roadmap
-------------

Last updated: 2011-03-07

This roadmap deliberately limits itself by the horizons of the current
design. That is, it would certainly be possible to dream further than
this document does, but this document doesn't.

FUTURE
------

The FUTURE is now here.

This has already allowed for some syntactic sugar that was quite difficult to
write before. For example, we now have named subs.

C backend
---------

It would be interesting to explore how fast a SIC *bytecode* interpreter
could be made to run. (SIC bytecode would simply be the textual SIC
instructions converted into a bytecode format.) The Perl 6 Yapsi runtime
isn't optimized to be fast, but this one could be.

Mid-term goals
--------------

+ &return
+ FIRST, LAST phasers
+ &last, &redo, &next (using control exceptions)
+ &return re-implemented using control exceptions
+ &die using control exceptions
+ INIT, END phasers
+ START phaser
+ ENTER, LEAVE/KEEP/UNDO phasers
+ PRE, POST phasers
+ CATCH, CONTROL phasers
