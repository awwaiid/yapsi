= Yapsi -- Yet Another Perl Six Implementation

This is an implementation of a Perl 6 compiler-and-runtime in Perl 6. It
currently runs off the old, pre-refactor branch of Rakudo known as 'alpha'.

Right now you can do things like this:

$ ./yapsi -e 'say 42'
42

$ ./yapsi -e 'my $a = 5; say $a'
5

$ ./yapsi -e 'my $a = 5; my $b := $a; $b = 42; say $a'
42

In other words, Yapsi currently handles declaration, assignment, binding,
and a very basic 'say' instruction.

The compiler also detects use-before-declaration and syntax errors.

$ ./yapsi -e '$a; my $a'
Invalid. $a not declared before use

$ ./yapsi -e 'say say'
Could not parse

== Near-future directions

Things we hope to implement in the immediate future:

* Blocks
* If statements
* Loops
* Function calls

== Raison d'Ãªtre

Besides being useful as a p6-in-p6 implementation, Yapsi also might work as
a fast vehicle for exploring the following underexplored areas of the Perl 6
spec:

* Phasers
* Constant folding
* Early catching of errors
* Increased communication between compiler and runtime
